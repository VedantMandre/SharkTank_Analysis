## Introduction
Welcome to the Predictive Modeling for Shark Tank Investment Deals repository. This project aims to predict the success of investment deals made on the popular TV show "Shark Tank." By employing various machine learning techniques, we analyze historical data to build models that can predict the outcome of investment opportunities presented on the show.

## Project Description
The project comprises two main components: Data Preprocessing and Predictive Modeling. We've implemented the entire project in Python, utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning tasks and matplotlib for visualizations.

### Data Preprocessing
- Our dataset consists of data from past Shark Tank episodes, encompassing information about deals, entrepreneurs, and episodes.
- The preprocessing phase involves addressing missing values, engineering relevant features, performing one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and standardizing numerical attributes.
- We also delve into textual data, tokenizing it and calculating word frequency features based on deal outcomes.

### Predictive Modeling
- After splitting the preprocessed data into training and testing subsets, we apply various classification algorithms to construct predictive models. These algorithms include Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Tree Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes Model, K-Nearest Neighbors Model, Random Forest Model, and Gradient Boosting Model.
- We evaluate each model using essential performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
- To fine-tune our models, we employ hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

### Results
- We compute accuracy scores for each model and present them.
- The results of hyperparameter tuning are displayed, showcasing the optimal parameters and cross-validation accuracies.
- We generate a bar plot that visually represents the AUC scores of the different models.

## Data
- Our dataset is sourced from [source link](https://example.com/dataset-link).
